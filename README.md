# Smartbroker Enhancer

This is the source code of a Google Chrome Extension to enhance the UI of smartbroker.de as long as there is no new release.

The extension takes care of the following things:

- Automatically ticks the website every 4min to keep you logged in (I hate it to be logged out after 4min)
- Tracks the history of all your transactions and shows you how much you really did per stock
- Allows transfer of all currently hold stocks into Finanzen.net to use the Finanzen.net app on a mobile device as stock tracker (appropriate smartbroker.de app is currently missing)
- Allows the transfer of all currently hold stocks into a watchlist of TradingView.com
- Allows you to get notified if an automatic sell happens
- Fixes this badly designed "Kaufen" button
- Account number prefill (without the need to store the password in the browser)
- Keep navigation menu open ("Depot" and "Trading")


Please use the issue function to propose new functionality.
